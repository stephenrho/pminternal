# Internal Validation of Clinical Prediction Models

This is a work in progress. 

The goal is to offer a package that can produce bias-corrected performance measures for binary outcomes for a range of model development approaches available in R (similar to `rms::validate`). Also contains function for assessing prediction stability as described here https://doi.org/10.1002/bimj.202200302.  

To install development version:

```         
devtools::install_github("stephenrho/pminternal")
```
